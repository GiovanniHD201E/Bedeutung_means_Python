# Olá! Hallo! Hello! 

## Parâmetros de comunicabilidade, expressividade, usw

Escrevo aqui sob os seguintes parâmetros:

- o texto deve ser excelentemente escrito se em português (do Brasil).
- if German or English is used, I beg your tolerance about my errors.

## Why Portuguese?

Clear ideas in this page are only assured if text is in Portuguese.

## Why German? 

Love, simple so! With "esmero" and careful, 'auch wenn' with unavoidable 
errors.

## English was loved...

Now it is used just for convenience and pragmatics concerns, without 
careful nor revision. I did not love it anymore, nevertheless I need it.

I, and oly I, is supposed to have rights of edition here. The link is: [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/GiovanniHD201E/Multifokus/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
